# Ignition Kit import (photo transcriptions)

Prompts from the OpX-Ignition-Kit, transcribed from screen photographs supplied by the
kit owner (work-machine transfer restrictions prevent direct file transfer). Content is
reconstructed faithfully; per-file transcription uncertainties are listed below.
No credentials appear in these files (env-var *names* like SONATYPE_USERNAME are
references, not values).

## Structural facts about the Ignition Kit learned from transcription

- Prompts are **VS Code Copilot prompt files** (`.github/prompts/NN-Px-name.prompt.md`)
  with frontmatter: description, name, argument-hint, **agent** (per-phase custom agents,
  e.g. `OpX-AppMod-P1-Discovery`), and a tools allowlist.
- Steps carry **per-prompt model-tier recommendations** ("Light (low thinking)") and
  estimated run times.
- The kit already has **artifact gates**: `.github/scripts/shared/verify-step-artifacts.ps1
  -Step N -Mode Input|Output` with `RESULT: OK` (exit 0) / `RESULT: BLOCKED` (exit 2) —
  input prechecks and output verification per step.
- **Step registry**: `/.github/instructions/step-registry.json` maps opaque step ids
  (e.g. `step:1fc2ba`) to human labels; prompts reference next steps by id.
- **State tracking**: `step-workflow-state.json` with a mandated human-readable readback
  block (Updated At / Recorded Step / Recommended Next Step).
- Conventions: legacy app copied to `LegacyCode/`; target is `src/<AppName>.Web.Api`
  (dotnet, **Scalar at https://localhost:4200/scalar**) + `src/<AppName>.Web.Client`
  (npm, https://localhost:5001). Docs under `/.modernization/.readme/`
  (Prerequisites.md, HowToRun.md). Package source: Sonatype (env creds + .npmrc/NuGet
  source checks). "Fusion G1" identifies a legacy Fusion generation.

## Structural facts added by prompt 02

- **The real Fusion Starter Kit layout** (corrects the reference kit's assumed
  `src/{Library,API,Client}`): `src/<App>.Library`, `src/<App>.Web.Api`,
  `src/<App>.Web.Client` — PascalCase backend naming, client as an `.esproj`
  (JS project system), scaffolded from `Starter.*` templates that Step 2 relabels.
- **Client baseline policy**: Angular even-major baseline, currently **Angular 20**.
- **Fusion specifics**: `AppInfo.xml` per project; `appsettings.json` Fusion keys
  (`Fusion.DataDirectory.PathBase`, `Fusion.Web.Api.OpenApi.Title`,
  `Fusion.Web.Client.Config.ApplicationName`); `<fusion-header label>` component;
  per-environment `fusion.config.*.ts` (e.g. `.dvl`) carrying Fusion OAuth hostnames
  that MUST NOT change during identity rename (later auth step owns them).
- **Run params**: `/.modernization/.readme/kit-params.md` holds `appName`;
  `.StepSummary.md` is a per-run human-readable step log; toolkit self-edits governed
  by `/.github/instructions/kit-update.instructions.md`.
- **Dual-surface completion model** (step 2): `physicalRenameStatus` +
  `referenceRewriteStatus` must both pass or the step reports `Blocked` — a
  two-column done-definition, not a single flag.
- Step ids observed: `step:1fc2ba`, `step:261769`.

## Structural facts added by prompt 03

- **Per-prompt model pins in frontmatter**: Step 3 carries `model: Claude Opus 4.6 (copilot)`
  directly in the prompt-file frontmatter — the kit pins specific models per step, not just
  tier hints in prose. (Step 3's prose tier is "Premium reasoning (high thinking)", 20-40 min.)
- **Schema contract versioning**: `step3ArtifactSchemaContractVersion: 1.0.1` in the prompt
  must match `.github/skills/step3-legacy-system-analysis/references/Step3-Artifact-Schema-Contract.md`
  — schemas are versioned artifacts owned by a *skill folder*, and prompts only keep an
  inline "minimum field floor". The kit has `.github/skills/` (screenshot-capture with
  SKILL.md + scripts/, step3-legacy-system-analysis with references/).
- **Hard Stops pattern**: numbered STOP gates inside the prompt (STOP 1 live-QA-URL
  resolution with exact priority order currentQaUrl → currentDevUrl → ask in chat → halt,
  plus a mandatory `qaUrlSource` echo; STOP 2 preflight limited to step-owned inputs, with
  non-step dependencies reported as "contract drift blockers"; STOP 2.5 modality branch;
  STOP 3 artifact completeness). STOP 2.5 classifies `detectedModality` as
  `api-only|mvc|spa|hybrid` from deterministic file-evidence criteria and everything
  downstream (artifact requiredness, response sections) branches on it.
- **Portal report system**: `.modernization/portal/data/json/` holds 9 named JSON reports
  (legacy-system-analysis, manifest-coverage, current-state-classification,
  runtime-topology, integration-contract-catalog, environment-and-secrets-map,
  data-and-cutover-risk, gap-and-exception-register, leadership-summary) seeded as
  skeletons by scripts and *enriched* by the agent; screenshots live under
  `.modernization/portal/data/images/<page>/`; portal publication is manual-only and
  never part of the done-definition. State files `step-workflow-state.json` and
  `step-response-ledger.json` also live under portal data and are written gate-authoritatively.
- **Ignition artifact layout**: structured analysis artifacts live in
  `.modernization/ignition-artifacts/discovery/` (service-behavior-inventory,
  interaction-wiring-inventory, workflow-trace-inventory) and
  `.modernization/ignition-artifacts/modernize/fusion-restructure/inventory.json`
  (apiEndpointCatalog, uiControlClassification, fusionPrimitiveCoverageCensus fields).
  Every entry must carry `legacyEvidence` with a real file path + line range; no
  fabricated placeholder rows.
- **Modality applicability matrix**: a Required/Conditional/notApplicable grid per
  artifact × modality feeds STOP 3; `notApplicable` artifacts must still exist with an
  explicit `{notApplicable: true, reason}` marker — absence is never a valid encoding.
- **Screenshot progression rule**: partial capture may proceed only with (1) ≥1 image,
  (2) explicit user review, (3) explicit user approval; zero images + none user-provided
  = blocked. User evidence goes under `.modernization/.readme/user-provided-info/` and is
  referenced as `captured-user-provided` matrix rows.
- **Legacy Visual Contract Capture**: Step 3 extracts a `legacyVisualContract` block
  (palette, typography, shellChromeRegions, navRouteModel, controlAndLabelRules, per-route
  field sets with `headerLabel`+`boundField`) in two layers — static (always, from source)
  and runtime (Playwright computed styles + per-route reference screenshots when the app
  is reachable; `runtimeMeasured: false` marker when not). Step 5 consolidates it into
  `.modernization/fusion-restructure/styling-foundation.json` + `ui-visual-contract.json`;
  Step 13 uses it as the field-parity/visual-parity answer key ("column-collapse parity
  defect" is a named failure class).
- **Deterministic response shape**: 10 exact response headings in fixed order with
  placeholder vocabulary (`NotApplicable`/`NoneDetected`/`Blocked`), mandatory counts
  (`cannotLocateCount`, `unknownBacklogCount`, `blockedArtifactCount`), and a fixed
  closing sentence for the readiness decision — response format is contract, not style.
- **Gate statuses**: the step gate yields three axes (`scanCoverageStatus`,
  `traceabilityStatus`, `planningReadinessStatus`), each `Ready|Constrained|Blocked`;
  `Constrained` still allows planning to proceed, `Blocked` stops Step 4.
- **Governing Sources section**: prompts end by delegating policy to canonical
  `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files (AppMod-Process,
  ui-capture-reverse-engineering, testing-design-contract, fusion-restructure,
  qa-portal-reporting, appmod-phase-agent-contract) + `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` —
  "do not re-derive the rules here".
- **Config/deployment conventions**: `connectionStringRuntimeInput` in kit-params.md;
  `OCPEnv` is the default final-state mode (alternatives `OpX`, `LocalIntegrated`/`OpEx`);
  default split SQL env var names `SqlServer__Server|Database|Username|Password|Encrypt|TrustServerCertificate`
  for the OpenShift/Kubernetes final state; Dapper row-model type hints
  (`dbParameterTypeHints[]`, `dbResultColumnTypeHints[]`) captured at discovery for
  Steps 8-9.

## Structural facts added by prompt 06

- **Step 6 = QA planning pack owner** (extracted from a previously overloaded Step 5):
  owns requirements doc, test plan, testing ownership matrix, characterization ladder,
  testcase catalog direction, testing strategy, regression plan, risk matrix, tool
  rationale, ADO CI/CD planning. Preceded by a **Legacy Unit Test Baseline pre-gate**
  (`legacy-unit-test-baseline.prompt.md`, a sub-prompt invoked from inside Step 6) that
  must report `step7ReadinessStatus: Ready` before quality design runs.
- **A QA prompt stack exists** under `.github/prompts/qaTestPrompts/` read in exact order:
  qa-core-master, qa-core-contract, qa-core-workflows, qa-plan-strategy,
  qa-legacy-characterization. Named reusable workflows: `[WORKFLOW] Modernization
  Solution Design`, `[WORKFLOW] Modern Build Planned QA Tests`.
- **owningStep routing table**: characterization → Step 7 (tests live in
  `LegacyCode/Characterization/Baseline/` — "the frozen baseline ships with the code it
  protects"); unit → Step 8 (`tests/backend/unit/`); integration/contract → Step 9
  (`tests/backend/contractApi|integrationBackend/`); browser-contract/e2e → Steps 10-16
  (`tests/frontend/`).
- **"Phase 2 has no derivation authority"**: the testcase catalog is the work order;
  Steps 7-17 implement entries verbatim, never analyze legacy code or add unplanned
  tests. Gap discovered mid-phase → stop → route back to Step 3/6 → refresh catalog →
  resume. Same drift-control philosophy as Squad-ik gates, applied to test planning.
- **Characterization = behavioral parity, not source-shape lock**: 7 backend behavior
  families (business rules, calculations, validation, API responses incl. every
  documented error path, DB side effects, legacy quirks "weird but load-bearing",
  permission behavior), each needing **three coordinated catalog entries**
  (characterization/unit/integration) unless a thin seam collapses to
  `coverageLevel: "single-layer"`. Frontend behavior is delegated to the UI Screenshot
  Parity lane (visual gates at Steps 11/12/15/18) — legacy screenshots are the contract.
- **C1-C9 source-shape lock rules** (structural floor): controller class presence, API
  action+verb, mutating-endpoint contract shape, EF entity shape, config seams,
  bootstrap/startup sequence, view/template markers (ng-* directives, @Scripts.Render),
  calculation-helper contracts, JS controller file presence (owningStep 10+, browser
  lane). Thin coverage marked `coverageLevel: "class-presence-only"` for QA Lane 5 audit.
- **8-rule per-service scenario derivation** reading Step 3 service-behavior-inventory
  fields (branchingParameters, throwGuards, nullCoalescingDefaults, ...): every public
  method ≥1 scenario; nullable returns get found+not-found; every throwing guard its own
  scenario; mode/flag branches one per mode; `??=` defaults two scenarios; collection
  methods empty-case; display decorators idempotency; delegation orchestrators one per
  path. Deterministic inventory→catalog mapping with rule-number traceability.
- **Five-tier API smoke safety model** (T1 unauthenticated reachability expecting
  401/403 → T2 CORS preflight → T3 authenticated invalid-body rejection with
  validation-gate file+line evidence that must precede the first mutation call → T4
  dry-run/pure-compute POST with grep-evidenced `mutatesState: false` → T5 ephemeral
  round-trip, **default OFF**, requires `dataSafety: ephemeral` in kit-params + explicit
  named user opt-in, forbidden against any data source whose loss would be noticed).
  T1 floor for every endpoint; real mutations belong to Step 12 integration with
  `page.route(...)` interception. 100% `apiSmokeCoverage` before Step 12.
- **Progress denominators contract**: qa-test-plan.json publishes `progressDenominators`
  (totalBackendFilesPlanned, totalApiEndpoints, totalRoutes, ..., plus extensions:
  totalErrorStates, totalExportSurfaces, totalRealtimeSurfaces, performanceBudgetRoutes,
  flakeBudgetPercent, dataFixtureCoverage, localesPlanned, routeStateParityFloor 90%);
  every Phase 2 percentage must be `done / total` citing real artifacts — "estimated
  percentages are forbidden" (appmod-phase-agent-contract rule 20).
- **Per-route behavior plan** (`per-route-behavior-plan.json`): per route
  `primaryDataCalls`, `interactiveElements` (with ownerStep 11/12/15+),
  `modalsAndBanners`, `placeholderDataPolicy: forbidden|allowedUntilStep<N>` — exists
  because "Steps 11 and 12 ship dead routes when they only have to prove 'the page
  renders' and not 'the page works'."
- **Testing accumulation plan Steps 7-17** with per-step targets (Step 8 >60% Library
  coverage growing to 80% by Step 9; Step 10 creates Playwright+Cucumber foundation;
  Step 17 = "S-TIER VERIFICATION GATE" 100% POM/Gherkin/aria/testid + >80% backend →
  Quality Score 95+ ready for Step 22), tracked in `test-accumulation-tracker.json`
  (updated by Steps 9-20, verified by Step 17; fields step17ReadinessScore,
  step22ProjectedScore).
- **Canonical planning script**: `qa-refresh-test-plan.ps1` is the authoritative
  generator for qa-test-plan/ownership-matrix/testcase-catalog + Step 8 layering-gate
  baselines (forbidden-references.json, slice-status.json) — "do not hand-author".
- **Frontend smoke lane doctrine**: one `ui-navigation-smoke.spec.ts` (~30-45s, read-only,
  no business transactions), shared helper `playwright-navigation-smoke-helper.js` under
  `.github/scripts/QA/`, exactly **one deterministic self-heal attempt** before reporting
  `Blocked`; smoke-evidence publisher is tracked infrastructure, not generated content.
- **Data-safety patterns**: Pattern A (live round-trip) for read-only GET/HEAD, Pattern B
  (interception) for mutating verbs; `ui-api-wiring-map.json` + spec template
  `_template/ui-api-wiring.spec.template.ts` drive mechanical derivation (Rule-Route-1).
- **Test root layout**: `tests/backend/{unit,contractApi,integrationBackend,smoke}`,
  `tests/frontend/{smoke,integrationFrontend,visualParity,e2e/{pages,journeys,
  accessibility,support}}`, `tests/modernization/characterization/{testcase,testResult}`;
  no step-named subfolders; one Markdown execution report per modernization step.
  Anti-Pact/perf-suite default: add only when compliance explicitly requires.
- Fixed closing line: `Ready for Step 7 Backend - Upgrade .NET: Yes or No` — and step
  names now confirmed: Step 7 "Backend - Upgrade .NET", Step 22 quality-score gate,
  Steps 9-20 update the tracker.

## Transcription uncertainties (prompt 06)

- Several headings/dashes render as garbled glyphs in the photos (e.g. "MANDATORY <?>
  Step 6 MUST assign a tier per endpoint"); transcribed as em dashes (`—`) — almost
  certainly UTF-8 em dashes displaying oddly at an angle.
- The owningStep routing table says characterization "Step 7 DEV authors and runs
  these", while the planning rule below it says "Step 7 QA uses these rows ... Step 7
  DEV does not run characterization tests" — tension preserved exactly as photographed.
- `test-accumulation-tracker.json` backendCoverage keys read `step6Target: 60`,
  `step7Target: 80`, `step15Target: 80` in the photo; the accumulation plan says Step 8
  >60% and Step 9 >80%, so these could plausibly be `step8Target`/`step9Target`/
  `step17Target` — transcribed as photographed and flagged.
- Line 525 says "Each step from 9-20 must UPDATE this tracker" while the exit criteria
  say scenarios are assigned to steps 7-17; preserved as-is.
- Execution order item 3 renders as "- 3." (stray list dash) in the photo; preserved.
- The "NO raw CSS or XPath selectors" bullet and Gherkin/data-testid/aria conventions
  appear detached after the bold Steps-7-17 paragraph (lines 378-391), likely displaced
  from the Playwright architecture section; transcribed in photographed order.
- Double-backtick identifier styling in the denominator sections preserved as shown.
- Long wrapped lines reconstructed; overlaps verified at 54-62, 92-114, 139-151,
  181-189, 222-245, 276-279, 315-321, 359-371, 411-422, 461-472, 516-522, 538-544.
- File ends at line 576.

## Structural facts added by prompt 05

- **Step 5 is the plan-closure gate** ("last major planning gate before implementation"):
  thirteen mandatory plan families — API Integration, Auth Integration, Test-Hook/Playwright,
  Data Fixture & Seeding, Performance Budget, Accessibility Audit, State Management,
  Realtime & Push, Logging & Telemetry, Environment Config, Cutover & Rollback,
  Test Isolation & Flake Budget, Localization — each recorded as a named plan array in
  `fusion-restructure/decisions.json`, each with the same drift-control rule: *"a Phase 2
  step that discovers a gap is a Step 5 planning gap and must route back here."*
- **Dominion confirmed as the acceptance-standard**: authoritative file is
  `/.github/skills/dominion-requirements/AppMod-Acceptance-Criteria.md` (fail-fast if
  missing). Fusion is the default target outcome; MVC/Razor/AngularJS/Angular are "source
  patterns or temporary bridges, not the target-state goal by default."
- **Three-axis Step 5 readiness**: `ownershipDecisionStatus`
  (DecisionGrade|NeedsFollowUp|Blocked), `userInputGateStatus`
  (Cleared|Outstanding|Blocked), `executionReadinessStatus`
  (ReadyForQualityDesign|NotReadyForQualityDesign|UserInputRequired|BlockedMissingArtifact) —
  with `UserInputRequired` (artifacts fine, human gates open) explicitly distinguished from
  `BlockedMissingArtifact` (upstream artifacts missing/stale).
- **Named markdown reports are canonical, JSON is companion**: Step 5 must produce
  `Modernization-Solution-Design.md`, `Modernization-Execution-Contract.md`, and
  `Modernization-Phase-Assessment.md` (read downstream by exact path; the Phase-Assessment
  must state a Step 8 disposition of `Skip`|`ValidateOnly`|`Execute`) plus three DEV-owned
  control-plane JSONs under portal data. Anti-hallucination contract: every control-plane
  JSON needs non-empty `reportId` + `title` so the shared verifier can reject "a truncated
  or hallucinated fragment"; field contracts live under **`.github/contracts/schemas/`**
  (new kit directory).
- **Immutable-baseline contract**: after Step 3, AI may write under `LegacyCode/` ONLY in
  `LegacyCode/<LegacyTestProject>/Characterization/Baseline`; all other legacy-tree writes
  (and any generated JSON/reports/portal pages) are forbidden — same principle as
  Squad-ik's read-only LegacyApplication/ rule. Step 7 upgrade workspace root:
  `.modernization/OpXUtil/Backup/LegacyCode_NET<major>_Upgrade`.
- **Code Quality Standards section** Steps 7-18 enforce (and Step 24 Technical Review
  verifies — confirming the 24-step count): .NET (nullable everywhere, no
  .Result/.Wait/GetAwaiter, ctor DI, methods <50 lines / classes <500,
  IFusionLogger/IFusionHttpClientFactory/IFusionCache, [Authorize] on all controllers),
  Angular (standalone components only, signals, @if/@for/@switch, inject()), a11y
  (aria-label, data-testid on all testables, landmarks, full keyboard), tests (backend
  >80% on Library, POM class per route + Gherkin per journey,
  MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedResult).
- **Wrapper capability vocabulary**: each `requiresWrapperCapability` gets
  `ShipFromDayOne`|`ExtendAtStep15`|`ExtendAtStep17Preflight`|`IntentionallyDeferred`;
  wrappers fronting generic Fusion primitives need permissive `options:
  Record<string, unknown>`; form-field wrappers need `readOnly`+`disabled` with derived
  `controlDisabled`; every wrapper passes through `elementId`+`testId` so `<label for>`
  and Playwright selectors survive the swap.
- **Carry-forward disposition vocabulary**: every material Step 3/4 item must end as
  `ResolvedByPlanningDecision`|`UserInputGate`|`OwnedByModernizationQualityDesign`|
  `OwnedByLaterStep`|`Blocked` — "do not report ready by feel."
- **Auth plan machinery**: legacy `Web.config` is authoritative for auth detection
  (`authentication mode="Windows"`, `AppletSecurity.SarRoleMapping` auto-populate
  kit-params); Okta issuer + default client id are pinned kit-wide (values redacted here);
  connection-string runtime intake uses shorthand `OCPEnv` (default OpenShift/K8s split
  env vars) | `LocalIntegrated`/`OpEx` (local Windows integrated) | `OpX` (operator
  deferral, tracked-not-blocking) | concrete config-file ref/connection string.
- **`No QA` run mode**: the exact phrase `No QA` in a request skips the mapped QA workflow
  for the run (noted as operator-requested) — the control-plane JSONs exist specifically
  so `No QA` runs still work.
- **Fixed response spine**: 12 ordered sections, a closing `User Input Required` block
  (`Required now` / `Optional` / `Auto-detected from legacy config` / `Operator
  deferrals`), and one explicit final line `Ready for Modernization Quality Design: Yes
  or No`.
- Frontmatter gains an `edit` tool entry (first Discovery prompt that writes artifacts);
  **no `model:` pin despite Premium reasoning tier** — so pins are not simply
  tier-correlated.

## Redactions (prompt 05 — deliberate, not uncertainties)

- Line ~138: the real Okta tenant URL pinned as `oktaIssuerOverride` is replaced with
  `https://<company-tenant>.okta.com` and an inline `REDACTED` comment.
- Line ~139: the concrete default Okta client ID (`0oa1…`) is replaced with
  `<default-okta-client-id>` and an inline `REDACTED` comment.
- Rationale: standing repo policy — no real Okta tenant hostnames or IDs in this repo.
  The work-side original pins the real values; restore them there, never here.

## Transcription uncertainties (prompt 05)

- Frontmatter tools list ends with a bare `- edit` (prompt 02 used `edit/editFiles`);
  transcribed as photographed.
- Double-backtick identifier styling appears from the Data Fixture section onward (mixed
  with single backticks earlier); preserved as shown.
- The `wrapperCapabilityPlan[]` bullet shows the decisions.json path without backticks,
  unlike sibling bullets; preserved as shown.
- "Step 5 closes from its own planning artifacts…" joined to the Dev-work bullet based on
  indentation in the photo.
- Long wrapped lines reconstructed from wrap positions; wording verified across photo
  overlaps at lines 14-59, 57-62, 98-108, 143-150, 189-199, and 236-246.
- File ends ~line 288 in the editor.

## Structural facts added by prompt 04

- **This is the Ignition scorecard step** (maps to Squad-ik's steps 03/19 scorecard
  machinery): a hybrid review with a deterministic layer and an AI-judgment layer, scored
  by closure formula `100 - (CRITICAL x 10) - (HIGH x 5) - (MEDIUM x 2)`.
- **"Dominion"** is the compliance/acceptance-criteria framework name ("Dominion
  compliance evidence", "Dominion criteria", "Dominion requirements").
- **Deterministic pattern catalog with stable IDs**: A1.x CRITICAL (-10 each, 5 patterns:
  hardcoded creds, SQL injection, tokens in localStorage, unsanitized innerHTML, sensitive
  data in logs), A2.x HIGH (-5 each, 18 patterns incl. FormsAuthentication, .Result/.Wait
  blocking, new HttpClient(), Session state, jQuery-in-Angular), A3.x MEDIUM (-2 each,
  13 patterns incl. missing OnPush, subscribe-without-unsubscribe, UseSwagger without dev
  check, verb-based URLs). Each row is Pattern + "What It Looks Like" example.
- **AI-judgment criteria with IDs**: B1 SOLID (5), B2 Security (4), B3 12-Factor (5),
  B4 API design (2, controllers only), B5 Angular (3, .ts/.html only) — plus file-level
  thresholds (class >500 lines HIGH, ctor >7 params HIGH, interface >15 methods HIGH)
  and an explicit "NOT violations" skip-list (DTO `new`, `static readonly`, IMemoryCache,
  `new` in tests).
- **Per-criterion scoring is data-driven**: criteria load from a versioned
  `acceptance-criteria-catalog.json`, each criterion gets `criterionId`/`baselineScore`
  (0..100)/`observedEvidencePaths[]`/`findingIdsContributing[]`/`confidence` in
  `baseline-review.json`; Step 5 plans remediation order from it and **Step 17 computes
  per-criterion `improvementDelta`** (baseline vs modern) — same before/after delta idea
  as Squad-ik's delta-report. Explicitly framework-generic (MVC, Razor Pages, Web Forms,
  Blazor, AngularJS, Angular, React, Vue, server-rendered HTML).
- **AI-judgment artifact with guardrails**: design-level criteria the scanner can't decide
  (SOLID SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP, stateless posture) surface as `UNKNOWN` unless an evidence-backed
  `judgments[]` artifact (`baseline-criterion-judgments.json`; Final phase uses
  `final-criterion-judgments.json`) resolves them. Guardrails: status must be
  PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL with >=1 cited `path:line - reason`; inferred-without-evidence is
  disallowed; deterministic rows are never overridden ("hard findings always outrank AI
  reasoning"); undecidable -> `PARTIAL` with reason, never a guessed clean result.
- **Step 4 three-axis status model**: `criterionCoverageStatus`
  (DecisionGrade|BroadButIncomplete|Blocked), `blockingGapStatus`
  (None|Present|BlockedByMissingEvidence), `planningInputStatus`
  (ReadyForStep5|NeedsFollowUp|Blocked). Step 4 is "incomplete" until findings are ranked
  into exact Step 5 planning inputs — evidence alone isn't done.
- **Cross-step courtesy rule**: `rename-verification.json` (Step 2-owned) unresolved items
  do NOT hard-block Step 4 when Step 2 is recorded complete in step-workflow-state.json —
  treated as informational. Steps don't re-litigate other steps' gates.
- **Model tier**: Balanced (medium thinking), 10-20 min; **no `model:` pin in this
  prompt's frontmatter** (unlike prompt 03's Opus pin) — pins appear only on the heavy
  reasoning steps.
- **Chunked review protocol**: process manifest files in chunks of 10-15, save progress
  after each chunk, require 100% file coverage verified by
  `P2-Modernize/verify-coverage.ps1` before `04-P1-generate-report.ps1 -Phase Baseline`
  refreshes `BASELINE-COMPLIANCE-REPORT.json` (portal). Fixed completion phrase:
  "BASELINE REVIEW COMPLETE".

## Transcription uncertainties (prompt 04)

- Two artifact roots appear for the same file: header block says **Output:**
  `.modernization/ignition-artifacts/discovery/baseline-review.json`, while the closure
  contract saves chunks to `.modernization/artifacts/reviews/baseline-review.json` (and
  the judgment artifact lives under `.modernization/artifacts/reviews/`). Transcribed
  exactly as photographed — possibly a source inconsistency or an intentional
  staging-vs-final split.
- The Per-Criterion Baseline Score section visibly uses **double backticks** around
  identifiers (e.g. ``criterionId``) unlike single backticks elsewhere; preserved as
  shown.
- `A2.6 async void` example shows a trailing space inside the backticks (`async void `);
  preserved.
- Long wrapped lines (status model, artifact contract, AI-judgment guardrails, closing
  bullet) reconstructed from wrap positions; wording verified across photo overlaps at
  lines 55-62, 112-118, and 157-175.
- File ends ~line 207 with trailing blank lines to 211 in the editor.

## Transcription uncertainties (prompt 03)

- Frontmatter shows only `description`, `agent`, `model`, `tools` — no `name:`/
  `argument-hint:` lines visible (unlike prompts 01-02). A "Configure Tools…" UI
  affordance appears between `model:` and `tools:`; transcribed as photographed.
- The Step Artifact Self-Check header may carry the "(QA-independent; works on `No QA`
  runs)" parenthetical seen in prompts 01-02; not legible in the photo, so omitted here.
- Source-internal inconsistency preserved as-is: the Required Artifacts table has **10**
  rows, but Required Response Sections / Output Normalization Rules say "each of the 7
  artifacts" / "list all 7 artifacts every run" (likely the A1-A7 schema artifacts).
- Line 88's `OPX_ENABLE_QA_PORTAL_REFRESH=1;` prefix transcribed exactly as shown
  (env-assignment + semicolon before a `powershell` invocation).
- Long wrapped lines (Hard Stops, capture requirements, enrichment rules, visual
  contract) reconstructed from wrap positions; wording verified across photo overlaps
  at lines 53-62, 101-109, 148-156, 203-208, and 251-260.
- File ends ~line 305 with trailing blank lines to 309 in the editor.

## Transcription uncertainties (prompt 02)

- Frontmatter `name:` line hidden behind the wrapped description in the photo;
  reconstructed from the visible filename.
- Line 6 in the tools list shows a "Configure Tools…" UI affordance, not file content.
- `npm run install` (Required Edits #6) transcribed as shown — possibly `npm install`
  in source; flagged rather than corrected.

## Transcription uncertainties (prompt 01)

- Frontmatter opening `---` not visible in photo (closing `---` at line 11 is); standard
  prompt-file frontmatter assumed.
- Lines 54-55 both appear in the source with near-duplicate wording (remove stale
  `.vs`/`obj` vs `.vs`/`bin`/`obj` "when the old build outputs are poisoning the legacy
  import graph") — transcribed as-is; possibly an intentional escalation, possibly a
  source duplication.
- Minor wrapped-line reconstruction in the Step Artifact Self-Check block (lines 22-24).
