# Ignition Kit import (photo transcriptions)

Prompts from the OpX-Ignition-Kit, transcribed from screen photographs supplied by the
kit owner (work-machine transfer restrictions prevent direct file transfer). Content is
reconstructed faithfully; per-file transcription uncertainties are listed below.
No credentials appear in these files (env-var *names* like SONATYPE_USERNAME are
references, not values).

## Index

| File | Phase/Step | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `prompts/01-P1-workstation-readiness.prompt.md` | P1 Discovery, Step 1 | transcribed from 2 photos |

## Structural facts about the Ignition Kit learned from transcription

- Prompts are **VS Code Copilot prompt files** (`.github/prompts/NN-Px-name.prompt.md`)
  with frontmatter: description, name, argument-hint, **agent** (per-phase custom agents,
  e.g. `OpX-AppMod-P1-Discovery`), and a tools allowlist.
- Steps carry **per-prompt model-tier recommendations** ("Light (low thinking)") and
  estimated run times.
- The kit already has **artifact gates**: `.github/scripts/shared/verify-step-artifacts.ps1
  -Step N -Mode Input|Output` with `RESULT: OK` (exit 0) / `RESULT: BLOCKED` (exit 2) —
  input prechecks and output verification per step.
- **Step registry**: `/.github/instructions/step-registry.json` maps opaque step ids
  (e.g. `step:1fc2ba`) to human labels; prompts reference next steps by id.
- **State tracking**: `step-workflow-state.json` with a mandated human-readable readback
  block (Updated At / Recorded Step / Recommended Next Step).
- Conventions: legacy app copied to `LegacyCode/`; target is `src/<AppName>.Web.Api`
  (dotnet, **Scalar at https://localhost:4200/scalar**) + `src/<AppName>.Web.Client`
  (npm, https://localhost:5001). Docs under `/.modernization/.readme/`
  (Prerequisites.md, HowToRun.md). Package source: Sonatype (env creds + .npmrc/NuGet
  source checks). "Fusion G1" identifies a legacy Fusion generation.

## Transcription uncertainties (prompt 01)

- Frontmatter opening `---` not visible in photo (closing `---` at line 11 is); standard
  prompt-file frontmatter assumed.
- Lines 54-55 both appear in the source with near-duplicate wording (remove stale
  `.vs`/`obj` vs `.vs`/`bin`/`obj` "when the old build outputs are poisoning the legacy
  import graph") — transcribed as-is; possibly an intentional escalation, possibly a
  source duplication.
- Minor wrapped-line reconstruction in the Step Artifact Self-Check block (lines 22-24).
